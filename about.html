    <P>
        A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for 
        coffee. It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit. This fruit
        is often referred to as a coffee cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, 
        the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee 
        beans are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of 
        their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; cherries or berries, most 
        commonly contain two stones with their flat sides together.
        A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the usual two. 
        This is called a "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between 10% and 15% of the time,
        and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) belief that they have more flavour 
        than normal coffee beans.[3] Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.[4]
